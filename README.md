## Seismic Hazard Analysis

This is a copy of the `sha_calc` package in the [gmhazard](https://github.com/ucgmsim/gmhazard) repository. Since the release of the new NZ NSHM the `gmhazard` workflow is outdated and is no longer used. However, the `sha_calc` contains lots of useful functions and models relevant for seismic hazard analysis.

The aim of this repository is to contain core functionality for performing simple (i.e. no logic tree support) probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) 
`based on both parametric and non-parametric ground motions predictions. Additionally, it contains core functionality for computing PSHA-based extensions, such as disaggregation, uniform hazard spectra (UHS), ground motion selection (GMS) and other related functionality such the computation of spatial IM realisation.
